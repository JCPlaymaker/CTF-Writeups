# Upload 101
Looking at source code we see a hint   
```<!-- HINT: Your file will not be uploaded for real. If you successfully upload a PHP file that would be interpreted by the web server, you will receive the flag. -->```   
Server returns flag if PHP file is sent(hmmmm)

``touch upload.png.php``

``FLAG-cN7MfUHhyLyrw4egOyYa4hr4v3aP5Iyp``
