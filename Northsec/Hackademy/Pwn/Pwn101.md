# Pwn 101
If we objdump -d pwn-01, we see that we have a line    
``40115a: 48 81 ec d0 00 00 00    sub    $0xd0,%rsp``   
Which substracts 208 from the stack but since we also need 8 for rbp we need to fill 216 bytes then overwrite the return addy with the addy of the buffer which the program gives us therefore we can use a shellcode attack to open and read the file cuz spawning a shell doesnt seem to be working
