When we load the challenge, we get get a hint that says:

``Can you figure out what changed between the address you found locally and in the server output?``

Which probably means that we need to compare the address locally and on remote.

Next we see that most security options with ``checksec`` are enabled so that musn't be the right path.

Going back to addresses, if we ``objdump -d`` the binary we will see that the win() function we are trying to reach is always 150 bytes below the main() function therefore when we receive the address of main() when running locally or on remote, we should right away substract 150 to that address and input the result to get the flag
