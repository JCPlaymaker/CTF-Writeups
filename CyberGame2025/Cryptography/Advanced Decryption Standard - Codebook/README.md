[☆☆☆] Advanced Decryption Standard - Codebook

Points: 1

EN: You know that feeling—waking up after a wild night of gambling, pockets full of keys you’re sure are yours, but somehow every single one feels wrong, and you can’t, for the life of you, remember which one fits where, or even what it’s supposed to unlock?

Now imagine being a novice cryptographer after that same night. You’ve got the keys—sure—but absolutely no clue what they open, how they work, or why you even have them in the first place. Welcome to the hangover of cryptography.

You think this file should contain a flag encrypted using... AES? Also, the letters ECB come to mind although you don’t know what it is. The flag should be in the usual format SK-CERT{something}.

key (hex format): 00000000000000000000000000000000
