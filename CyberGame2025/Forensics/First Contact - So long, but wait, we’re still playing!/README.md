# [☆☆☆] First Contact - So long, but wait, we’re still playing!

### Points: 1

EN The alien ship updated their omnipresent dashboards after the second flag: ants are out. One last jellyfish remains in the game. One octopus. And you. Meanwhile, the orcas fled the planet. No pressure, right?

New day, new challenge. The message says:

Jura vg pbzrf gb pryrfgvny zbirzragf, FX-PREG{ebg4gv0a} vf cvibgny.

Additional instruction from the jellyfish:

* do NOT enter dumb stuff. The flag is in the form SK-CERT{something}, not FX-PREG.

* this time you may need CyberChef
