# [☆☆☆] First Contact - Hard choices

### Points: 1

EN: The sky tore open as the ship descended, a gleaming monolith against the midday sun. Without warning, every screen flickered - phones, billboards, watches - replaced by a single message: "You are invited." A voice followed: "This is the first contact. Your species has been selected to participate in CyberGame, an interstellar CTF. Success grants you access to galactic science, post-scarcity tech, and diplomatic recognition. Failure means we proceed with scheduled construction of a hyperspace bypass that, regrettably, requires the demolition of your planet. Here is Message One."

Then a stream of cryptic data pulsed across the screens - elegant, alien, and waiting.

Additional instructions from the Earth Command:

* download the file,

* find a hidden message,

* the messages are in the format SK-CERT{something} unless stated otherwise. Enter the full flag from the first "S" to the last "}".

* do not write anything else into the answer field; the aliens expect the exact flag.
